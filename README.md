# Magisk Module for Android Backup Restore Project

> [Android Backup Project](https://github.com/AndDiSa/android_backup_project) is a instrumentation toolkit which enables backup (and restore) of Android applications together with their data off a running (Magisk rooted) Android device

> Standard [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) permissions are too restrictive to let the [Android Backup Restore](README.md) toolkit doing its work. This module adapts the permissions up to a level so that the toolkit can finally do its work.

## Supported architectures
- `arm64`, `arm`, `x86`, `x86_64`

## Instructions
- Install `AndroidBackupRestore` from [Magisk Manager](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk)
- Install `AndroidBackupProject` from [Android Backup Project](https://github.com/AndDiSa/android_backup_project)
- Have a look at [Support thread in XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/tools-anddisa-backup-restore-tools-t4016617) and read the instructions

## Issues?
- open an issue on [AndDiSa/mm-android-backup-restore](https://github.com/AndDiSa/mm-android-backup-restore)

## Please note
- This module does not provide any functionality (beside changing the policy definitions). Principally it's useless without [Android Backup Project](https://github.com/AndDiSa/android_backup_project)
